# Smallworks

Smallworks gives small businesses easy access to technologies that were previously only accessible to larger businesses, due to costs associated with their implementation, customization and support. It increases efficiency and productivity for small businesses, thus, reducing the scale advantage larger businesses enjoy. Smallworks offers its services in a self-serve manner, similar to how consumer digital services are offered, which is more scalable for the service providers. Large costs are associated with the high level of customization and administration large businesses demand, which Smallworks aims to eliminate or reduce significantly. The conomic value of said savings are then passed on to small businesses, making them more competitive in the larger economy.
